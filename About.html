      <pre style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; text-align: left;"><code>
        I was born in Brazil and immigrated to the United States at the age of 13. 
        Now 34, I currently run my own business as a self-employed professional. 
        Over the years, I’ve worked in sales and focused heavily on real estate, where I made significant investments. 
        However, my passion for learning has never faded. This drive led me to pursue a path in software engineering,
        where I discovered a strong interest in web development. 
        Although the bootcamp experience has been fast-paced and challenging, 
        I’m confident that with time, dedication, and consistent practice, 
        I will overcome any obstacles and continue growing in this exciting new field.

        As a junior software engineer, I have developed foundational skills in JavaScript programming
        and web design, including CSS and layout techniques. 
        Although I am still at the beginner level, I am confident that by the end of this course, 
        I will have mastered these essential areas.
