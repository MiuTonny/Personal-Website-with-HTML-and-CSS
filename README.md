# Personal-Website-witI first created the index.html file, establishing a portfolio with a clean semantic HTML structure. I then built additional pages for Home, About Me, Portfolio, and Contact, creating a separate HTML file for each. After completing the structure, I applied styling using style.css to maintain consistency across all pages.
Each section was linked appropriately and included images representing my projects, such as a simple calculator, a temperature converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa), and a webpage debating different cat breeds. Every file was structured semantically to ensure proper organization and accessibility.
The main objective of my website is to showcase my three projects along with the associated JavaScript code.h-HTML-and-CSS
